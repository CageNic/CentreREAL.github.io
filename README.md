## Approach to working openly  
We work openly to share our approach, methods and areas of research.
We use open source tools; and opt for what we consider to be the correct tool for the correct task

## Data sources and data management
We use open source data which we can share. Where we use sensitive data, we can describe it, but cannot comment on the exact contents and reference the names of any files used
