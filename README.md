# Welcome to my github homepage
No fancy plugins used to create the homepage - just markdown and html from the README.md file  
And image files in /images sub folder

## Approach to working openly  
We work openly to share our approach, methods and areas of research.
We use open source tools; and opt for what we consider to be the correct tool for the correct task

## Data sources and data management
We use open source data which we can share  
Where we use sensitive data, we can describe it, but cannot comment on the exact contents or reference the names of any files used
